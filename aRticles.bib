 title={Plant Animal Interactions: An Evolutionary Approach}, ISBN={978-1-4443-1229-4}, abstractNote={Interactions between plants and animals are incredibly diverse and complex and span terrestrial, atmospheric and aquatic environments. The last decade has seen the emergence of a vast quantity of data on the subject and there is now a perceived need among both teachers and undergraduate students for a new textbook that incorporates the numerous recent advances made in the field. The book is intended for use by advanced level undergraduate and beginning graduate students, taking related courses in wider ecology degree programmes.   Very few books cover this subject and those that do are out of date.}, note={Google-Books-ID: u4jAB7_7srsC}, publisher={John Wiley & Sons}, author={Herrera, Carlos M. and Pellmyr, Olle}, year={2009}, month={Apr}, language={en} }

The plant is cultivated worldwide in warm-temperated regions but systematic pollination of the ornithophilous species by local birds has not been reported, and, consequently, seed production is rare outside of South Africa. We found that a member of the New World warblers, Geothlypis trichas, efficiently carried out pollination of S. reginae in southern California, thereby supplementing its typical diet of insects with the energy-rich nectar of S. reginae. Only occasionally, seeds were found in plantings not visited by these birds. The pollinator service provided by the warbler increases seed production in an area outside of South Africa. This could lead to adaptive changes in the exotic species, advance species establishment and persistence and possibly promote invasive behavior in a non-native environment.}, number={2}, journal={South African Journal of Botany}, author={Hoffmann, F. and Daniel, F. and Fortier, A. and Hoffmann-Tsay, S. -S.}, year={2011}, month={Apr}, pages={503–505}, language={en} }

Contrary to a previous view, Batcsian mimicry does not appear to apply to pitcher traps because: (a) there is no evidence of insects visiting traps by mistake, (b) no model is known for any one of the traps, (c) the duration of the trap activity and the structure of the plant community are not compatible with a deceptive mimetic status, (d) nectar which is a real reward is provided to visiting insects by the pitcher plants. It is suggested that these plants perform mutual rather than deceptive relations with the insect communities in their habitats. Insects benefit from nectar which is provided by pitchers and which serves for their nutrition in habitats where sources of floral nectar might be either uncommon or absent. At the same time the insects pay the plants in a small portion of their community which is ‘sacrificed’ as prey and consumed by the plants, which grow in nutrient deficient soils.}, number={2}, journal={Biological Journal of the Linnean Society}, author={JOEL, DANIEL M.}, year={1988}, month={Oct}, pages={185–197} }

  title={Coexistence of mutualists and antagonists: exploring the impact of cheaters on the yucca - yucca moth mutualism}, volume={128}, ISSN={0029-8549}, DOI={10.1007/s004420100669}, abstractNote={Mutualists and non-mutualistic cheaters commonly coexist, but the effect of mutualist-cheater interactions on the evolution and stability of mutualisms or persistence of cheater populations is not well understood. Yuccas and yucca moths are an example of an obligate mutualism in which cheaters are frequently present. Larvae of both pollinators and cheaters eat developing yucca seeds, but cheaters no longer pollinate and rely on the mutualist species for seed availability. In this study we focus on interactions between the cheater Tegeticula intermedia and the pollinator T. yuccasella in fruits of the host Yucca filamentosa. We examined the effect of pollinator and cheater density on larval mass and larval mortality, the effect of fruit mass on larval interactions, and the degree of variability in pollinator-cheater interactions across 3 years. This study was done in a natural population to determine whether these two larval species affect each other under natural conditions. Genetic markers (both protein electrophoresis and DNA sequencing) were used to identify the larvae to species. We found no correlation between larval number and mortality for either pollinators or cheaters. Furthermore, pollinator mass was not correlated with number of cheater larvae per fruit in any year. Mass of cheater larvae was not correlated with number of pollinator larvae per fruit in two of three years; in one year, there was a negative correlation between number of pollinator larvae on mass of cheater larvae only in small fruits. Our results suggest that larval competition between species is weak and asymmetric; when it occurs, cheater larvae incur the cost. The number of cheaters and pollinators per fruit was negatively correlated in two of three years. The lack of a positive correlation in number of cheater and pollinator larvae per fruit may contribute to lowering the potential for seed competition among larvae. In addition, larval density per fruit differed across years by as much as 30%. However, this degree of difference was apparently not enough to cause seed limitation because no effect of pollinator larvae on either mass or mortality of cheater larvae was detected in years with the highest larval densities per fruit. In contrast to the weak effects of pollinator-cheater interactions, fruit mass accounted for much of the variation in number and mass of both pollinator and cheater larvae within and across years. Larger fruits generally had heavier and higher numbers of larvae compared to smaller fruits. Overall, in this population at least within the time period studied, pollinators and cheaters coexisted with little conflict in fruit. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that the recent rapid radiation of species in the T. yuccasella complex may be explained in part by the ability of multiple pollinator species (some of whom have become cheaters) to use fruits without severe competition.}, number={3}, journal={Oecologia}, author={Marr, Deborah L. and Brock, Marcus T. and Pellmyr, Olle}, year={2001}, month={Aug}, pages={454–463}, language={eng} }

 title={Disclosing the double mutualist role of birds on Galápagos}, volume={8}, ISSN={2045-2322}, DOI={10.1038/s41598-017-17592-8}, abstractNote={Life on oceanic islands deviate in many ways from that on the mainland. Their biodiversity is relatively poor and some groups are well-represented, others not, especially not insects. A scarcity of insects forces birds to explore alternative food, such as nectar and fruit. In this way, island birds may pollinate and disperse seed to an extent unseen on any mainland; they may even first consume floral resources of a plant species and then later harvest the fruit of the same species. Through this biotic reuse, they may act as double mutualists. The latter have never been studied at the level of the network, because they are traditionally considered rare. We sampled pollination and seed-dispersal interactions on Galápagos and constructed a plant-bird mutualism network of 108 plant (12% being double mutualists) and 21 bird species (48% being double mutualists), and their 479 interactions, being either single (95%) or double mutualisms (5%). Double mutualists constitute the core in the pollination-dispersal network, coupling the two link types together. They may also initiate positive feedbacks (more pollination leading to more dispersal), which theoretically are known to be unstable. Thus, double mutualisms may be a necessary, but risky prerequisite to the survival of island biodiversity.}, journal={Scientific Reports}, author={Olesen, Jens M. and Damgaard, Christian F. and Fuster, Francisco and Heleno, Ruben H. and Nogales, Manuel and Rumeu, Beatriz and Trøjelsgaard, Kristian and Vargas, Pablo and Traveset, Anna}, year={2018}, month={Jan}, pages={57} }

Because mutualisms can bind species to a common fate, mutualism breakdown has the potential to expand and accelerate effects of global change on biodiversity loss and ecosystem disruption. The current focus on the ecological dynamics of mutualism under global change has skirted fundamental evolutionary issues. Here, we develop an evolutionary perspective on mutualism breakdown to complement the ecological perspective, by focusing on three processes: (1) shifts from mutualism to antagonism, (2) switches to novel partners and (3) mutualism abandonment. We then identify the evolutionary factors that may make particular classes of mutualisms especially susceptible or resistant to breakdown and discuss how communities harbouring mutualisms may be affected by these evolutionary responses. We propose a template for evolutionary research on mutualism resilience and identify conservation approaches that may help conserve targeted mutualisms in the face of environmental change.}, number={12}, journal={Ecology Letters}, author={Toby Kiers, E. and Palmer, Todd M. and Ives, Anthony R. and Bruno, John F. and Bronstein, Judith L.}, year={2010}, pages={1459–1474}, language={en} }
